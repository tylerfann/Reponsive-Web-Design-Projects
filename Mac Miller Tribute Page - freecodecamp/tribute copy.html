        <p>Malcolm James McCormick (January 19, 1992 â€“ September 7, 2018), known professionally as Mac Miller, was an American rapper, singer, and record producer.</p>
        <p>Miller included Big L, Lauryn Hill, the Beastie Boys, Outkast, and A Tribe Called Quest among his influences. He also had a close relationship with fellow Pittsburgh rapper Wiz Khalifa, saying "Wiz has been a big brother to me with this music thing so far. Our relationship is beyond music. He really is just my homie, whether I will be making music or not."</p>
        <p>Miller died of a drug overdose in his Studio City home on September 7, 2018. On September 11, 2018, thousands of fans held a vigil in Miller's honor at Pittsburgh's Blue Slide Park, in respect to his 2011 debut album of the same name.</p>
